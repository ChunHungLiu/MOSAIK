Overview:

MOSAIK is a stable, sensitive and open-source program for mapping second and 
third-generation sequencing reads to a reference genome. Uniquely among current 
mapping tools, MOSAIK can align reads generated by all the major sequencing 
technologies, including Illumina, Applied Biosystems SOLiD, Roche 454, 
Ion Torrent and Pacific BioSciences SMRT.

Running the demo:

To see a full list of the available command line options, enter the bin
directory and run any of the program without any extra parameters.

Included in this release is an Illumina data set featuring reads E.Coli.

To test MOSAIK with this data set, just enter the demo directory and 
type Build, and Align to run the appropriate scripts.

example:

> cd demo
> ./Build.sh
> ./Align.sh

The resulting bam file (read.mka.bam) will be found in the
demo/fastq directory.
